This project will read the data from the excel sheet using oledb drivers and show the data in the form of pie chart.
We read the data in the backend (C#) and passed it to the front end using asp hidden variable. On frontend, I read 
the data and created the pie chart using google chart. 

Technologies used - 
1) ASP.Net Webforms
2) C#
3) Object oriented Javascript 
4) Jquery
5) GoogleChart Api


Precautions for the excel reading - 
1) Name of the sheet of the excel should be  'Sales'.
2) Internet should be available (to download google charts js).


Limitations - 
1) In this project, At a time we can only read 100 rows(This number can be extended).
2) No spell check is done as data doesnot require communication from database.
3) User is not allowed to download the pie chart.
